# Quality-control-microarray-data

Quality control was performed for the data generated by immunosignature. 

**Step 1: Intensity transformation and normalization**


<br />


**Step 2: Descriptie statistics for quality control** 


<br />


For each array, a set of statistics characterizing its signals are generated, including:

<br />

i. Median intensity before normalization 
<br />
ii. Fraction of library peptides at scanner maximum of 65,535 before normalization
<br />
iii. Fraction of library peptides with zero signal before normalization
<br />
iv. Full width at one quarter of the maximum of the transformed intensity distribution
<br />
v. Average intra-array CV of serum control peptides
<br />
vi.	Pearson correlation to technical replicates before and after normalization 
<br />
vii. Pearson correlation to other serum samples before and after normalization 
<br />
viii. Average linker-only signal
<br />
ix. Full width at one quarter of the maximum of the transformed intensity distribution
